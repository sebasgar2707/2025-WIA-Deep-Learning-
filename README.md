# 2025-WIA-Deep-Learning-
This repository contains the programming assignments for the lecture "Deep Learning, Neural Networks and Applications".


# WIA: Neural Networks, Deep Learning and Applications

This is an application-oriented course with programming assignments in Python/Tensorflow.

The course proceeds in three phases: Lecture part, project part, and excursion/project presentation. The lecture part takes place as a face-to-face event every Monday 16:40 - 18:10, Room Z21/381 and Wednesday 16:40 - 18:10, Room Z21/381 during the first six weeks of the semester (exact dates: see below).

The programming projects include tasks and datasets from automated vehicle testing and are provided by Fahrzeugsystemdaten GmbH (FSD) and co-supervised by Marina Dolokov from FSD. Since proprietary measurement data from FSD GmbH is used, a confidentiality agreement must be signed before starting the project work.

The programming assignments for the lecture part will be provided later via the Github platform and can be executed in Google Colab even without your own Python/Tensorflow installation.

## Schedule

### Phase 1 (Lecture part): (April - Mid-May)

(Currently, some slides from SoSe 21/22 are linked; these will be replaced by the new slides during the semester)

* Mon 7.4.: Introduction to Neural Networks and Deep Learning & Training Neural Networks
* Wed 9.4.: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) 
* Mon 14.4.: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
* Wed 16.4.: Generative Modelling (ONLINE Lecture! https://us06web.zoom.us/j/86037877817?pwd=0mSckgso1nbvr0MpkzbmqtRyf6l0Jm.1)
* Mo 21.4.: Easter holiday --> NO LECTURE!
* Wed 23.4.: Programming Lab I (Introduction to Tensorflow / Pytorch and Music Generation with RNNs) 
* Mon 28.4.: Presentation of FSD and FSD Project Tasks 
* Wed 30.4.: Explainable AI (XAI) 
* Mon 5.5.: Programming Lab II (Digit Classification with CNNs in Tensorflow / Pytorch) 
* Wed 7.5.: Programming Lab III (Diagnosing Bias in Facial Detection Systems)
* Mon 12.5.: Diffusion Models 

### Phase 2 (Project part): (Mid-May - End of June)

* Mon 14.5.: Interim discussion of FSD project tasks
* Wed 19.5.: Interim discussion of FSD project tasks
* Mon 26.5.: Interim discussion of FSD project tasks
* *Submission date Wed 18.6.* !!

Working on the project tasks in small groups (3-4 persons).
An interim discussion is mandatory for each group.
The programming projects include tasks and datasets from automated vehicle testing and are provided by Fahrzeugsystemdaten GmbH (FSD) via Github. 
The project result should be presented in a written report (about 15 A4 pages in font size 10-12 per group) and in a presentation (about 30 minutes per group). Additionally, the program code is also part of the project submission. In the written report, the contributions of each group member must be marked (e.g., by different font colors). Report, program code, and presentation together constitute the examination performance. The deadline for report and program code submission is Wednesday, June 18, 2025. The program code and the report are submitted by uploading them to the GitHub repository (link to follow). Please also submit the project report by email to marina.dolokov@fsd-web.de.

The group allocation will be decided on May 6 and uploaded here.

### Phase 3 (Excursion/Project presentation): (June 23)

On Monday, June 23, a full-day excursion to FSD GmbH will take place. The presentation on FSD practical tasks will be held during this excursion. Please keep this day free. Further information will follow soon.
